To increase the robustness of this analysis, we also perform a permutation test on our meta-regression models. The resulting estimate for the coefficient of the first principal component is 1.16, which is not statistically significant (p = 0.12). Our model explains a small portion of the heterogeneity, accounting for only 3.32% (Table 1). Figure 3D visualizes the meta-regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Table S7.

Therefore, we explored the relationship between PC1 and callback by category. Given the limited number of levels across categories (Figure 3B), it was not possible to calculate a meaningful effect size directly relating ratings to callback at the study level. Thus, we present a graphical representation in Figure 3B, with lines representing fitted linear models for each study (Table S7). For some categories, the relation between callback and PC1 is positive (e.g., nationality, which also samples a larger number—35—of categories). For most other categories, however, such as wealth, sexuality, and parenthood, there are both positive and negative slopes in different studies. Under the category of sexuality, slope signs in four studies were equally split between positive and negative, which is especially striking given the large range of ICCs across signals."

Our results reveal that the level of agreement between raters differs across various studies, with agreement ranging from excellent to good in most studies (Figure 2A, Table S2).\n\n2.2.1 Figure 2A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe callback rates were computed by averaging the deci- sions of multiple hiring managers. Meanwhile, the warmth and competence scores were obtained from a different sample. To ensure reliable social perception measurements, we specif- ically recruited participants residing in North America with demographics closely resembling those of the average hiring manager, and we averaged ratings across raters. This enabled us to confidently match the social perception ratings with the callback rates per name. Those warmth and competence ratings, across names in different studies, are shown in Figure 2A.\n\n\n2.2.2 meta models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n      estimate\n      \n        95% CI\n      \n      p-value\n      SE\n    \n    \n      lower\n      upper\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      competence1\n    \n    black_c2\n-11.52\n-23.74\n0.71\n0.06\n3.84\n    female_c3\n-3.07\n-9.56\n3.42\n0.32\n2.91\n    \n      warmth1\n    \n    black_w2\n-6.72\n-19.19\n5.76\n0.19\n3.92\n    female_w3\n2.88\n-4.39\n10.16\n0.40\n3.27\n    \n      callback4\n    \n    black5\n0.79\n-0.51\n0.04\n0.07\n0.09\n    female6\n1.02\n-0.03\n0.06\n0.36\n0.01\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 The meta-analytical involves the inverse variance method and a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for tau^2.

Figure 2D shows how the principal component scores (y-axis) are related to warmth and competence ratings (x-axis). The first component (PC1) reflects the positive association; it explains 79.3% of the variance. PC2 is high when only one rating is high. It accounts for only -78.3% of the total variance, indicating its less prominent role in the overall data structure. As a result, our subsequent analyses will focus on the PCs rather than the original ratings that generated them."

Furthermore, the variance of the true effect sizes distribution is significantly greater than zero (\\(\\tau^2=\\) 0.08, 95% CI [0.03 − 0.66]).\nGiven the large level of heterogeneity in our analysis, we find a wide prediction interval (from -0.42 to 1.12, suggesting that future studies could potentially reveal negative correlations. Therefore, caution is warranted in interpreting the results, and further research is needed to clarify the effect of social perception on callback."

We found that \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)(callback, PC1) in (21) is closest to the pooled effect, and we, therefore, used data from this study to make predictions. Specifically, we trained a linear model on all names except one and then used this model to predict the callback for the left-out name. Fig. S7 visually represents our findings, with lighter shades of blue indicating lower callback rates. Our analysis reveals that callback rates are highest in the upper quadrant of the warmth and competence scale, while the callback rates are lowest in the lowest quadrant of this plot. Interestingly, we also observe clusters of the race that the names would signal (Black, White, or foreign-sounding)."

To increase the robustness of this analysis, we also perform a permutation test on our meta-regression models. The resulting estimate for the coefficient of the first principal component is 1.16, which is not statistically significant (p = 0.09).

Therefore, we explored the relationship between PC1 and callback by category. Given the limited number of levels across categories (Figure 3B), it was not possible to calculate a meaningful effect size directly relating ratings to callback at the study level. Thus, we present a graphical representation in Figure 3B, with lines representing fitted linear models for each study (Table S7). For some categories, the relation between callback and PC1 is positive (e.g., nationality, which also samples a larger number—35—of categories). For most other categories, however, such as wealth, sexuality, and parenthood, there are both positive and negative slopes in different studies. Under the category of sexuality, slope signs in four studies were equally split between positive and negative, which is especially striking given the large range of ICCs across signals."

The plot displays the contribution of each study to the overall heterogeneity (measured by Cochran’s Q) on the x-axis and its impact on the pooled effect size (defined as the standardized squared difference between the overall estimate based on an equal-effects model with and without the ith study included in the model) on the y-axis. Our analysis found that Kline significantly influenced the heterogeneity but did not significantly affect the pooled effect size. On the other hand, Neumark contributed moderately to the overall heterogeneity but substantially impacted the pooled effect size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. S3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot displays different influence measures for each study, which help to identify potential outliers that do not fit well into the meta-analysis model. No study was detected as an outlier based on these measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. S4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot displays the overall effect and I2 heterogeneity of all meta-analyses with ρ(callback, PC1) as effectsize that were conducted using the leave-one-out method. The forest plot is sorted by the I2 value of the leave-one-out meta-analyses. The results show that excluding neumark leads to the largest reduction in I2, reducing it from 82% to 64%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. S5\n\n\n\n\n\nWe implemented a Graphical display of heterogeneity (GOSH) plot analysis. For this analysis, we fit all possible subsets 2k−1 of our k included studies. Each subset’s pool effect size \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) is plotted on the x-axis, and the between-study heterogeneity I2 on the y-axis. Three (k-means, DBSCAN, gmm) clustering algorithms are used to determine patterns in the above scatter plot. The three algorithms did not consistently identify clusters therefore, we conclude that based on this analysis, no single study needs to be excluded from estimating the meta-model.\n\n\nIn order to ensure the robustness of our findings and account for potential outliers, we conducted a comprehensive outlier and heterogeneity analysis. Overall, only two out of eight tests identified outliers.\nWhen excluded, re-estimate \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) as 0.4 or 0.36 , both values remaining close to the 0.34 all-study estimate in Figure 2C.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Egger’s regression test (Fig. S6; intercept = 1.86, 95% CI [-0.44, 4.16], t = 1.58, p = 0.16) did not indicate bias."
